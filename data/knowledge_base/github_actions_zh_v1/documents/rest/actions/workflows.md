# 工作流的 REST API 终结点

使用 REST API 与工作流 GitHub Actions进行交互。

## 关于 GitHub Actions 中的工作流

可以使用 REST API 查看存储库的 GitHub Actions工作流。
工作流程通过广泛的各种工具和服务自动化软件开发生命周期。有关详细信息，请参阅文档中的 [](/zh/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflows)GitHub Actions。

> \[!NOTE]
> Most endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>` and `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` headers, plus `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10`. Curl examples below omit these standard headers for brevity.
